# 🤖 GitHub Repository Companion – AI Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot that enables users to interact with the contents of any public GitHub repository in natural language. Simply provide a GitHub repo link, and get the Insights of the Repository summarizing the README.md file. The assistant can summarize code, explain logic, answer questions, and guide you through unfamiliar codebases — all powered by LLMs and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
